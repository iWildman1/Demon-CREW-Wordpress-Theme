Demon CREW
===

The theme running behind the Demon CREW website

Notes
---------------

The site implements three main plugins in order to achieve it's uniqueness. These are Advanced Custom Fields, Custom Post Types UI, and a generic plugin to remove the 'category' section of the permalinks. Without these plugins, the theme will not function.


* Download and install a fresh WordPress installation.
* Copy 'demon-crew' to the 'wp-content/themes/' directory.
* Activate the theme.
* Install previously mentioned plugins.
